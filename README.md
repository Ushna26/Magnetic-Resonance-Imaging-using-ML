# Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-using-Python
The dataset of magnetic resonance imaging is in decoded form with 874 entries and 145 columns. 
Class label is a categorical variable and all other are numeric type variables. 
are two class labels in this dataset one is FEP (First-episode psychosis) and the second one is HC (Healthy Controls). 
Our aim is to detect or identify whether the patient is First episode psychosis (FEP) or Healthy Control (HC) using the classification algorithms. 
To achieve this we used support vector machine and naïve Bayes algorithm on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. 
Support vector machine (SVM) is best fitted method on this type of data give 86% accuracy better than Naïve Bayes (NB) Classifier with accuracy of 74%. 
We get good accuracy results with support vector machine classifier.
